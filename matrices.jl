#= I figured that since the actual project is about multiplying matrices
I will just do that then worry about reading them in later =#

mat1 = [1 2; 3 4]

print("Matrix 1 \n", mat1, "\n\n")

mat2 = [4 3; 2 1]

print("Matrix 2 \n",  mat2, "\n\n")

print("Multiplication \n")

mat3 = mat1*mat2

print(mat3, "\n")

#= okay so that worked very well, super simple.
  Now we can get into the good stuff=#
